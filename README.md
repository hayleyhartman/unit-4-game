# unit-4-game
This game was a project completed in August 2018 in order to demonstrate understanding of basic jQuery and javascript concepts such as jQuery syntax, if/else blocks, and click events.
Each time the game starts (when the page is loaded, when a user wins or when a user loses), it loads new random values for each gem and a new goal for a value to hit. By clicking each gem, the user adds to their total value. If they hit the goal value, they win; if they overshoot the goal value, they lose. Either way, their score is adjusted and the game restarts itself.
